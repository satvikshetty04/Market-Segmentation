Market segmentation divides a broad target market into subsets of consumers or businesses that have or are perceived to have common needs, interests, and priorities. These segments help firms or businesses focus on their target groups effectively and allocate resources efficiently. 

In this project, we aim to find such market segments given social network data. These social relations can be captured in a graph framework where nodes represent customers/users and edges represent some social relationship. The properties belonging to each customer/user can be treated as node attributes. Hence, market segmentation becomes the problem of community detection over attributed graphs, where the communities are formed based on graph structure as well as attribute similarities. 

Ultimately, we evaluate the obtained segments through influence propogation.
